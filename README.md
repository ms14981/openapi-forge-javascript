## OpenAPI Forge - JavaScript

This repository is the JavaScript template for the [OpenAPI Forge](https://github.com/ColinEberhardt/openapi-forge), see that repository for usage instructions:

https://github.com/ScottLogic/openapi-forge

## Development

### Testing

The standard test script is used to execute the BDD-style tests against this generator.

```
npm run test
```

The script expects that the openapi-forge project (which is where the BDD feature files are located) is checked out at the same folder-level as this project.

### Linting

Two scripts are available to help you find linting errors:

```
npm run lint:check:all
```

This runs eslint in check mode which will raise errors found but not try and fix them. This is also ran on a PR and a push to main. It will fail if any errors were found.

```
npm run lint:write:all
```

This runs eslint in write mode which will raise errors found and try to fix them.
